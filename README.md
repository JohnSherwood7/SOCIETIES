# SOCIETIES
Distributable, stable version of SOCIETIES last updated DEC 2015 

This code runs an agent-based simulation of an economy that grows from the ground up. 
Agents are self-interested utility-maximizers who extract, consume, and trade resources. 
They also invent tools, machines, factories, and industries that reduce the effort required to extract resources. 
Simple technologies are gradually repurposed from their original uses into components of more complex technology.
Through trade and technology the economy evolves from a group of isolated, self-sustaining but resource-poor agents to a society 
with a high degree of specialization, interdependence and wealth. 
The computer simulations show that introducing trade, tools, innovation, a
nd diffusion of technology increases total resources extracted, productivity, degree of specialization, and interlocking complexity. 
The extraction of each resource gradually becomes dependent on other resources, 
to the point that introducing scarcity in one resource causes an economic collapse until new technologies are invented. 
At the same time these generate increasingly wide variance in wealth across agents.
